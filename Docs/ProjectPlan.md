## 1 Introduction

This project is to create a simple android app to allow a user(s) to enter and store job offers. These job offers can be ranked and displayed based on the user's personal preference for certain offer components.

## 2 Process Description


**Inception**
- 	In this phase, we will need requirement specs
- Analyze requirements and briefly touch on the timeline for construction of the product, including a product plan.
- 	Identify leaders for each role based on experience
-	This activity will concluded upon delivery of a UML class document, a use case model, and a project plan. 

**Elaboration**
- 	In this phase, we will need the UML class document and use case model from the previous phase
-	This activity will produce a test plan, a design document, and a document detailing any other functional or non-functional requirements
-	The design document will asses technical limitations of the system, address any requirement gaps, enumerate assumptions, and develop a detailed system architecture including but not limited to low level and component diagrams, UI/UX design, and system and hardware environments
-	A review and refinement of the use case model and project plan will be done at this step
-	Begin working on creating test cases and a testing plan for the application
-	A thorough review of these documents and sign off from all team members will complete this phase.

**Construction**
-	In this phase, we will need the inputs from the previous two phases
-	This phase will consist of development of the app itself based on the specification from the design docs in the previous phases as well as concurrently developing testing strategies
-	The output of this phase is a working alpha version of the product as well as a UserManual.md to describe how to use the app. This will include not only a version of the code  in the master branch but also a compiled .apk file
-	We will also need both unit tests and integrations tests, which pass, in order to complete this phase.

**Transition**
-	In this phase, we will need all previous phases' outputs so that we can review the documentation, the code base, and the test cases and make any and all changes necessary 
-	This phase will output a final working artifact and all previous design documents fully updated. It will also have a comprehensive suite of test cases (unit, integration, regression) for use in all future maintenance. 
-	The output of this phase is a final version of the app that passes all the test cases with sign off from all team members
